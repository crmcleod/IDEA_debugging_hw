Answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
Pauses the code before that line is run to inspect the current state.
2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
No.
3. How do we debug the next line of code?
Stepover.
4. What does the step into command do?
Moves to the top of the class method being invoked on that line.
5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
Evaluate expression will evaluate a single viable line of code - doesn't take semi-colons. Evaluate code fragment allows multiple lines  to make extended evaluations (can take local variables too). Needs semi-colons.
